      <description>On Windows Vista 64 and Windows 7 64, there is a 32 bit version of Remote Desktop Connection (Microsoft Terminal Services Client, mstsc.exe) in %SystemRoot%SysWOW64. Running this mstsc.exe will launch the 32 bit process but it will instantly launch the 64-bit mstsc.exe from System32 and shut itself down. This makes it impossible to run Remote Desktop Connection 32 bit. This is a problem when you have 32 bit Terminal Services add-ins (which won&amp;rsquo;t run under 64 bit).</description>

      <description>One of the things I learned long ago was to always have more than 1 drive or have my single drive partitioned. You keep your programs and operating system on the C drive. On your D drive goes all your data, downloads and anything that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to vanish on you suddenly. A couple of advantages of this are:  This keeps the C drive quite lean if you want to make an image of it.</description>
