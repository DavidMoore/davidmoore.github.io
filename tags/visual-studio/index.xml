      <description>We’re switching our legacy C++ projects from Visual C++ 2010 to the Visual C++ 2012 Runtime, now that Microsoft allows you to target Windows XP for C++ in 2012 (available in Visual Studio Update 1).
So that involves switching the Platform Target from v100:

To v110_xp:

Well upon compilation, I saw these errors for one particular project:

The key error being Error C2039: &amp;lsquo;SetDefaultDllDirectories&amp;rsquo; : is not a member of &amp;lsquo;`global namespace&amp;rdquo; from line 638 in atlcore.</description>

      <description>I find I have to generate GUIDs often (mostly due to using WiX) and the in-built Tools &amp;gt; Create GUID tool is too cumbersome for this. I found a blog post that has a simple macro you can customize to bind a keyboard shortcut to paste in a new GUID Here are some full instructions, using their simple macro code:  Tools &amp;gt; Macros &amp;gt; Macro Explorer (or hit ALT+F8) Right click Macros, choose New Macro Project&amp;#8230; Choose a location for the Macro project and give it a meaningful name then click Add Rename Module1 to something more meaningful, then double-click to edit the module Insert the code to paste a new GUID into the current cursor position / selection:  Public Sub PasteNewGuid() DTE.</description>

      <description>This details how you can debug an application running on a remote machine from Visual Studio on your local machine, as if the remote application was running on your local machine. The keys are:  There must be a user account with the same username and password on the remote machine and the local machine (MACHINE account, not domain account). Visual Studio 2008 Remote Debugger must be installed and running on the remote machine under the user account in point 1  Create local machine account  Right click My Computer &amp;gt; Manage Expand Computer Management &amp;gt; System Tools &amp;gt; Local Users and Groups Right-click Users under Local Users and Groups and choose New User&amp;#8230; Enter in the username e.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting this error a bit lately as I trying to add new projects to the solution, and then add them to source control: The project  cannot be added to source control. In folder , it overlaps a project that is already bound to source control at a lower root. To avoid this problem, add the project from a location below the binding root of the other source controlled projects in the solution.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m running Visual Studio 2008 on a old, single-core laptop with 1GB RAM.
VS is a resource hog, so it&amp;rsquo;s not long before my laptop is struggling having a reasonable size solution in addition to the usual open applications.
There are a few things you can do to try and squeeze a bit more performance out of Visual Studio I&amp;rsquo;ve found from various blogs and looking around myself. The first two are the most useful.</description>
