      <description>In some of the work I&amp;rsquo;m doing right now, I&amp;rsquo;m manipulating an assembly after compile time - having it disassembled into IL, tweaked, then re-compiled back into an assembly. The assembly is signed and what is being done to the assembly is breaking the strong name. This is quite comforting to know; the strong name wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so strong if it was that easy to hack an assembly with a strong name.</description>

      <title>Configuring NLog for your application when NLog is in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC)</title>

      <description>If you have several applications that are using NLog, it can be a good idea to install NLog into the GAC and reference that. A gotcha you must watch out for is caused by this piece of configuration from the NLog site:        Because you are not using the strong name for the Assembly-qualified name of ConfigSectionHandler, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to do a GAC lookup, therefore NLog won&amp;rsquo;t be found and you&amp;rsquo;ll get an application error (even if NLog is actually in the GAC).</description>
