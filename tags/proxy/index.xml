      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m working on a .NET hobby project.
At a simple level, I&amp;rsquo;m writing a web proxy implementation, ï¿½ and was using 8080 as the default port.
When trying to write and run unit tests to make sure my server was binding to this port and shutting down as and when expected, I found I could connect to 8080 even when the proxy wasn&amp;rsquo;t running. Telnet-ing to that port would initiate a connection, and would eventually drop out at varying speeds, and immediately if I hit a key.</description>
