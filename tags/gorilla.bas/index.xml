      <description>Nostalgia time!
Back when I got my first PC, QBasic was part of the operating system.
I spent hours and hours playing around with QBasic and MS-DOS Editor (or simply edit as we all knew it) to see what graphics and games I could whisk up.
There was a game that came with QBasic and MS-DOS called Gorillas, which was effectively like Worms and Scorched Earth.
Look at those mind-blowing graphics!</description>
