      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite common on many websites, particularly forums, to post links to images.
Unlinker is a very popular plugin for Firefox, which allows you to change the links to images in the page to in-line images.

I&amp;rsquo;ve made a simple script to implement a very basic version of Unlinker.</description>

Their intial study results are in, taken from 3 and a half million URLs.
Interestingly, tables are still right up there with most popular tags, suggesting there are still a lot of people using tables for layouts, particularly when you see this quote:</description>
