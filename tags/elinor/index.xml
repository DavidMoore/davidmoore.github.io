      <description>Elinor and Julia visited from New Zealand, and we went to Paris and hung out in London for a few days. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted some photos on Facebook but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to blog something about it at some point. Was good fun, and nice to see Els and get some travel done (even if it was to Paris again).
So I&amp;rsquo;m ready to get cracking into work again and get prepared for my return to New Zealand which is really only weeks away.</description>
