      <description>We had a problem this week where a merge module from a third party was causing our installer to fail under UAC.
The installation was being elevated, but the custom actions (which were doing things such as file system and registry operations) were still failing due to security exceptions.
The root cause was that the merge module contained custom actions that were still not being run under the elevated account.</description>

      <description>I had a bit of trouble getting WC3Banlist (mainly due to its dependency on WinPcap) on Windows 7 This is working on Windows 7 RC1, with User Acount Control (UAC) on (set to Default) I did quite a few things when troubleshooting so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to replicate the exact steps, but here&amp;rsquo;s some instructions on how I have it set up now: Install WinPcap  Download WinPcap 4.1 Right click the downloaded installer exe and choose Properties Go to the Compatibility tab In Compatibility mode, Tick &amp;ldquo;Run this program in compatibility mode for:&amp;rdquo; and choose Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) from the drop-down Tick &amp;ldquo;Run this program as an administrator&amp;rdquo; in Privilege Level Hit OK Run the exe and go through the normal installation  Install WC3Banlist  Download WC3Banlist Right click the installation file and choose Run as administrator Untick &amp;ldquo;Install WinPcap 3.</description>
