      <description>Opera is my favourite browser, and the final release of the newest version has just been released to the public.
It&amp;rsquo;s blazing fast, and comes with a lot of stuff out of the box such as:
 Integrated ad blocker (right click on a page and choose Block Content&amp;#8230;, then you can click on what you want to block) Mouse gestures Mail and chat client Widgets Speed dial (If you create a new tab, you get a patchwork of thumbnails of your selected favourite sites so they&amp;rsquo;re one click away) Pretty much everything that a lot of other browsers had to follow suit with after Opera had innovated them, and usually need to be downloaded in an extension or plug-in.</description>
