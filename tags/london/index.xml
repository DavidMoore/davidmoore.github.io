      <description>Elinor and Julia visited from New Zealand, and we went to Paris and hung out in London for a few days. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted some photos on Facebook but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to blog something about it at some point. Was good fun, and nice to see Els and get some travel done (even if it was to Paris again).
So I&amp;rsquo;m ready to get cracking into work again and get prepared for my return to New Zealand which is really only weeks away.</description>

      <title>London Visa News</title>

      <description>News on the London front! I still have quite a few months left on my visa, but my 12 months of allowed work are nearly used up. This means I can still stay in London but won&amp;rsquo;t be allowed to work.
My job wants to keep me on, so I will basically have to come back to NZ for a short time soon. From there, work will arrange sponsorship for me, and I will then re-enter London on a work visa that lasts for up to 2 years and is then renewable.</description>
