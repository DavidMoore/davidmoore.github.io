      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting this error a bit lately as I trying to add new projects to the solution, and then add them to source control: The project  cannot be added to source control. In folder , it overlaps a project that is already bound to source control at a lower root. To avoid this problem, add the project from a location below the binding root of the other source controlled projects in the solution.</description>
