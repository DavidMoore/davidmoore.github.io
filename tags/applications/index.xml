      <description>Opera 10.5 Beta is out and it&amp;rsquo;s very impressive, and looks pretty stunning due to its Windows 7 integration.
One thing I don&amp;rsquo;t really like is how it shows all the tabs using Aero Peek when you click it in the Task Bar.
You can turn this off:
 Type &amp;ldquo;opera:config&amp;rdquo; in the address bar and hit Enter Scroll down to User Prefs and expand it, or type in &amp;ldquo;Windows 7&amp;#8243; in the search box Untick the &amp;ldquo;Use Windows 7 Taskbar Thumbnails&amp;rdquo; setting Click Save Restart Opera  </description>

      <description>Opera 10 Beta 3 is out! The timing is uncanny because the last time I did a clean install of Windows 7, Beta 2 came out hours after I had done a new install. Today I installed Windows 7 RTM on my machine at work, and then hours later, a new beta of Opera 10. What the? [Opera 10 Beta 3 @ opera.com]</description>

      <description>Opera 10 Alpha last night prompted me to automatically update, and lo and behold it installed the Beta 1. The most noticeable change is the default skin, which is lighter and more consistent, using some new etching effects and icons everywhere. More changes are on the horizon for this for Beta 2, from the skin designer John Hicks. A cool new enhancement is you can drag down the tab bar to get thumbnails for all the tabs, known as Visual Tabs: There&amp;rsquo;s now an interface to customize the Speed Dial (rather than manually editing ini files) Opera Turbo, the Opera proxy service that offers compression of web pages (suitable for low-bandwidth connections) is built in and can be switched on or off or set to auto mode (turning itself on if it detects you&amp;rsquo;re on a slow internet connection).</description>

      <description>Opera has built-in torrent support which is very handy and nice, but not quite as nice as a full-fledged client like uTorrent To disable the Torrent support in Opera so that uTorrent or your default torrent client will be used instead:  In Opera, type in opera:config in the address bar and hit enter Click the Bit Torrent section to expand it  Untick Enable  Hit Save Click OK at the message box  You won&amp;rsquo;t have to restart Opera for this change to take effect</description>

      <description>Opera 10 Alpha is out!
Apart from it being an updated and faster engine, it also adds 100% ACID3 support, HTML Email Composition (finally!), integrated spell checker, and automatic updates.
All this on top of the in-built features like mouse gestures, integrated ad blocker, the slick mail, news feed and chat client, Bit Torrent support, Wand password manager, desktop widgets etc.</description>

      <title>Opera &#34;Unlinker&#34; User JavaScript</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite common on many websites, particularly forums, to post links to images.
Unlinker is a very popular plugin for Firefox, which allows you to change the links to images in the page to in-line images.
Opera doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a fully-fledged plugin system like Firefox (which is a pro just as much as it is a con), but you can customize it using User JavaScript.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made a simple script to implement a very basic version of Unlinker.</description>

      <description>The Opera guys have created a project called MAMA &amp;#8211; &amp;ldquo;Metadata Analysis and Mining Application&amp;rdquo;. It is designed to trawl the web and analyse what technologies and techniques are actually being used in web pages.
Their intial study results are in, taken from 3 and a half million URLs.
Interestingly, tables are still right up there with most popular tags, suggesting there are still a lot of people using tables for layouts, particularly when you see this quote:</description>
