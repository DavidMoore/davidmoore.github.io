      <description>We had a problem this week where a merge module from a third party was causing our installer to fail under UAC.
The installation was being elevated, but the custom actions (which were doing things such as file system and registry operations) were still failing due to security exceptions.
The root cause was that the merge module contained custom actions that were still not being run under the elevated account.</description>
