      <description>Firefox still tends to be a bit of a memory hog over an extended period of time, even though the latest major version (3) has made massive memory usage improvements over previous versions. This tweak will make sure Firefox behaves more like standard Windows applications when it comes to being minimized, as in freeing up the memory it&amp;rsquo;s using for Windows. The down-side to this is that when restored or maximized again, there will be a delay as the application shifts chunks from slow virtual memory to system memory.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m running Visual Studio 2008 on a old, single-core laptop with 1GB RAM.
VS is a resource hog, so it&amp;rsquo;s not long before my laptop is struggling having a reasonable size solution in addition to the usual open applications.
There are a few things you can do to try and squeeze a bit more performance out of Visual Studio I&amp;rsquo;ve found from various blogs and looking around myself. The first two are the most useful.</description>
