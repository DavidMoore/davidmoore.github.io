      <description>The New Zealand Under-20 rugby team is playing in the inaugural IRB Junior World Championship and just thrashed Ireland 65-10.
I watched some of the coverage at the TVNZ site (they have full footage of both halves here).
There was a flanker playing for Ireland called David Moore. While I skipped through the video I managed to see him give away a couple of penalties, including for a blatant head-high clothes-hanger tackle.</description>
