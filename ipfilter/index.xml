      <description>The IPFilter updater takes in a set of one or more inputs, and one or more outputs.

Inputs Input URIs The input must be resolved to an absolute URI. While the final URI must be absolute, there are shortcuts and abbreviations to make the specified input(s) more concise and readable.</description>
