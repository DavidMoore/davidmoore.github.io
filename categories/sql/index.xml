It is obviously based on Visual Studio Code, so is extensible and scriptable, and potentially the SQL Operations Studio features may be added to VSCode later.
The product already has an incredibly useful, customizable dashboard feature, as well as support for viewing SQL Query Plans and Execution Plans.
There is also a connection manager that handles Azure connection.</description>
