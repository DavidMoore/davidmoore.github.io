      <description>You can create a machine account login for SQL Server with the following command:
CREATE&amp;#160;USER&amp;#160;[MACHINENAME]&amp;#160;FOR&amp;#160;LOGIN&amp;#160;[DOMAIN\MACHINENAME$]&amp;#160;WITH&amp;#160;DEFAULT_SCHEMA=[dbo]  </description>

      <title>Generating a type library for Visual Basic 6 ActiveX Components</title>

      <description>When generating setup code or isolation code (for Side by Side assemblies and Registration-free COM), VB6 ActiveX Components can be a little troublesome.
ActiveX exes in particular can be difficult, with the WiX heat tool and various SxS tools not being able to harvest COM registration information from them properly.
A good way of avoiding these problems is to generate a type library (.tlb) from the VB6 component, and then pointing the code generation tools at the type library.</description>

      <description>This post covers the cause of a bug I ran into at work.
Our application would check for available updates when it started, and if they were found, it would launch the installer directly and exit the application immediately, so that the installer could run without encountering file locks.
The installer was complaining our executable was still locked, meaning it had to schedule the overwrite of the old file with the new one after a reboot.</description>

      <title>.NET Decompilers</title>

      <description>Reflector history The de facto .NET decompiler has been Reflector for what seems like forever.
Reflector was originally developed by Lutz Roeder, and made freely available to the community.
It was acquired by Red Gate Software in August 2008, who promised to maintain it as a free product.
They reneged on this promise in February 2011, stating that Reflector would become a commercial product.
This created a community backlash, culminating in creation and/or promotion of several free rival products through open source or offered by other vendors.</description>

      <title>How to check if the current user is an Administrator (even if UAC is on)</title>
      <link>http://www.sadrobot.co.nz/blog/2011/06/20/how-to-check-if-the-current-user-is-an-administrator-even-if-uac-is-on/</link>

      <description>There may be a scenario where you want to determine from code if the current user is an Administrator.
One example of this which I have had to deal with is checking for software updates.
Say your application contacts a service to see if there is a newer version of the application available; if so, you can download and run the installer.
Imagine that the installer requires admin privileges; you donâ€™t want to run the installer if the current user does not have administrative privileges.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve had a dog you&amp;rsquo;ll know how they often twitch and move their limbs in their sleep. Well, this dog is like that but on a whole other level. Must have scared the crap out of the owners the first time she did this. How about sleep barking? Sleep running in circles Imagine if the dog was narcoleptic too</description>

      <description>The Digg Reel is a show over at &amp;ldquo;Internet Television&amp;rdquo; site Revision 3.
They find the most popular videos posted on digg.com and package them together in a little hosted show. They even pick out some of the choicest user comments on the videos, reference other videos, and occasionally some pretty terrible but funny special effects and gags of their own.
While you might already have seen some of the videos during the week if you haven&amp;rsquo;t been hiding under a rock, you&amp;rsquo;ll at least be sure you&amp;rsquo;re not missing out on any of the viral videos of the moment.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been one to pack a lunch for work, especially sandwiches (MEH @ sandwiches). So noone&amp;rsquo;s ever stolen my lunch from the office fridge, but then I don&amp;rsquo;t know who does those kinds of things.
Someone&amp;rsquo;s come up with a very simple but effective deterrant: a sealable lunch bag with a mould print on it.Before After
The makers seem to want to charge money for this, but you can probably make your own very easily.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably already seen the infamous Bill O&amp;rsquo;Reilly flips out video. If not, here it is:
There&amp;rsquo;s some pretty funny remixes of it too.
Bill O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Producer
One of the intriguing things about the original is thinking how people react off camera and deal with the irrate O&amp;rsquo;Reilly. You hear a little bit of the producer on the original, but you still have to wonder how he manages the man day to day, and somehow gets O&amp;rsquo;Reilly to actually finish the piece.</description>
