      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made some minor changes to the IPFilter Updater.
The list mirror it was using was out of date, so I&amp;rsquo;ve found a new list provider (I-Blocklist) and obtained their permission to point at that list.
The project has also now been re-hosted on Codeplex.

      <description>Opera 10.5 Beta is out and it&amp;rsquo;s very impressive, and looks pretty stunning due to its Windows 7 integration.
One thing I don&amp;rsquo;t really like is how it shows all the tabs using Aero Peek when you click it in the Task Bar.
You can turn this off:
 Type &amp;ldquo;opera:config&amp;rdquo; in the address bar and hit Enter Scroll down to User Prefs and expand it, or type in &amp;ldquo;Windows 7&amp;#8243; in the search box Untick the &amp;ldquo;Use Windows 7 Taskbar Thumbnails&amp;rdquo; setting Click Save Restart Opera  </description>

      <title>Running 32-bit Remote Desktop Connection on Windows 64 bit</title>

      <description>On Windows Vista 64 and Windows 7 64, there is a 32 bit version of Remote Desktop Connection (Microsoft Terminal Services Client, mstsc.exe) in %SystemRoot%SysWOW64. Running this mstsc.exe will launch the 32 bit process but it will instantly launch the 64-bit mstsc.exe from System32 and shut itself down. This makes it impossible to run Remote Desktop Connection 32 bit. This is a problem when you have 32 bit Terminal Services add-ins (which won&amp;rsquo;t run under 64 bit).</description>

      <description>Microsoft Security Essentials is a free anti-virus program. All of the free anti-virus programs out there have usually pretty quickly fallen out of favour with me, in particular the previous community darling AVGFree. Having a free option from Microsoft, that performs extremely well with minimal resource usage, is a boon. For privacy reasons, you might want to opt out of the Microsoft SpyNet. Opting out is a very manual process though, with instructions here Download Microsoft Security Essentials</description>

      <description>Opera 10 Beta 3 is out! The timing is uncanny because the last time I did a clean install of Windows 7, Beta 2 came out hours after I had done a new install. Today I installed Windows 7 RTM on my machine at work, and then hours later, a new beta of Opera 10. What the? [Opera 10 Beta 3 @ opera.com]</description>

      <description>I had a bit of trouble getting WC3Banlist (mainly due to its dependency on WinPcap) on Windows 7 This is working on Windows 7 RC1, with User Acount Control (UAC) on (set to Default) I did quite a few things when troubleshooting so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to replicate the exact steps, but here&amp;rsquo;s some instructions on how I have it set up now: Install WinPcap  Download WinPcap 4.1 Right click the downloaded installer exe and choose Properties Go to the Compatibility tab In Compatibility mode, Tick &amp;ldquo;Run this program in compatibility mode for:&amp;rdquo; and choose Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) from the drop-down Tick &amp;ldquo;Run this program as an administrator&amp;rdquo; in Privilege Level Hit OK Run the exe and go through the normal installation  Install WC3Banlist  Download WC3Banlist Right click the installation file and choose Run as administrator Untick &amp;ldquo;Install WinPcap 3.</description>

      <description>Opera 10 Alpha last night prompted me to automatically update, and lo and behold it installed the Beta 1. The most noticeable change is the default skin, which is lighter and more consistent, using some new etching effects and icons everywhere. More changes are on the horizon for this for Beta 2, from the skin designer John Hicks. A cool new enhancement is you can drag down the tab bar to get thumbnails for all the tabs, known as Visual Tabs: There&amp;rsquo;s now an interface to customize the Speed Dial (rather than manually editing ini files) Opera Turbo, the Opera proxy service that offers compression of web pages (suitable for low-bandwidth connections) is built in and can be switched on or off or set to auto mode (turning itself on if it detects you&amp;rsquo;re on a slow internet connection).</description>

      <description>The IPFilter Updater application now has its own page: http://www.davidmoore.info/ipfilter-updater/ uTorrent is one of the most popular BitTorrent clients out there. In my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s the best. You can set up IP filtering in uTorrent to block bad seeds and peers from a list maintained by the community. How to set up IP filtering in uTorrent  Open up uTorrent and go to Options &amp;gt; Preferences from the menu or click the Preferences button in the toolbar Select the Advanced option in the tree Find ipfilter.</description>

      <description>Opera has built-in torrent support which is very handy and nice, but not quite as nice as a full-fledged client like uTorrent To disable the Torrent support in Opera so that uTorrent or your default torrent client will be used instead:  In Opera, type in opera:config in the address bar and hit enter Click the Bit Torrent section to expand it  Untick Enable  Hit Save Click OK at the message box  You won&amp;rsquo;t have to restart Opera for this change to take effect</description>

      <description>One of the things I learned long ago was to always have more than 1 drive or have my single drive partitioned. You keep your programs and operating system on the C drive. On your D drive goes all your data, downloads and anything that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to vanish on you suddenly. A couple of advantages of this are:  This keeps the C drive quite lean if you want to make an image of it.</description>

      <description>iTunes without the bloat, and the invasive Quicktime installer + annoying Bonjour service. Install Quicktime Alternative, then the iTunes installer from Ajua Online. That&amp;rsquo;s currently 17.8MB for the iTunes installer, and 10.8MB for Quicktime Alt. As opposed to the 80MB of bossy Apple iTunes installer.</description>

      <title>Improve Mozilla Firefox 3 memory usage</title>

      <description>Firefox still tends to be a bit of a memory hog over an extended period of time, even though the latest major version (3) has made massive memory usage improvements over previous versions. This tweak will make sure Firefox behaves more like standard Windows applications when it comes to being minimized, as in freeing up the memory it&amp;rsquo;s using for Windows. The down-side to this is that when restored or maximized again, there will be a delay as the application shifts chunks from slow virtual memory to system memory.</description>
